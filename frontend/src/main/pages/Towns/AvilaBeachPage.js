         <b>>Avila Beach, California</b> is a small town in San Luis Obispo county.
         It is a popular beach destination because it is in a small secluded cove.
         The nearby Port San Luis was once the main port for the San Luis Obispo
         area at the time the main way that
         goods were transported was by boat.  The main entrance to the
         Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant is located just outside Avila Beach.
